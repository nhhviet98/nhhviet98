## 📌 About me

- 👋 Hi, I’m @nhhviet98
- 👀 I’m interested in the field of AI, GenAI, and MLOPs.
- 🌱 I’m currently working as an AI Engineer at Da Nang, Viet Nam.
- **Hash tags**:`Artificial Intelligence` `GenAI` `MLOps` `Computer Vision` `NLP`

## 🔥 My Journey

> Focusing on the transition from "it works on my machine" to "it works for the world."

- **Learning & Adapting**: currently curious about the evolving landscape of GenAI. I enjoy the challenge of learning new architectures and figuring out how they can be applied to solve real-world problems.

- **Building for the Long Run**: don’t just stop at training a model. I find great satisfaction in the MLOps side of things—ensuring that research actually makes it into production.

- **Practical Problem Solving**: My experience has taught me that a model is only as good as the value it brings. I focus on bridging the gap between theoretical research and the engineering required to make AI reliable and efficient in a production environment.

- **Supporting the Team**: I’ve been fortunate enough to lead technical initiatives and mentor others. For me, leadership isn't about the title, but about being the person who helps remove blockers and fosters a collaborative environment where we can all build better tech together.
